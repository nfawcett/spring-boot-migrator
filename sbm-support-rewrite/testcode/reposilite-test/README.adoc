# Artifact Repository Test

Test that artifacts available in a private artifact repository configured in `~/.m2/settings.xml` and `~/.m2/security-settings.xml` can be accessed.
This is important as many enterprise projects use their private artifact repository to retrieve private dependencies.

A local and private artifact repository (https://github.com/dzikoysk/reposilite[reposilite]) is started in a docker container.
The reposilite instance has a user configured (admin:secret) which can deploy and access artifacts.

A project that uses this dependency is parsed.
After successful dependency resolution the types of this artifact must be available on the AST.

The `user.home` is set to point to `testcode/reposilite-test/user.home` which contains a `.m2` directory providing access configuration to the reposilite instance through `.m2/settings.xml` and `.m2/security-settings.xml`,
